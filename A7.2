	you see two caves. In one cave, the dragon is friendly
	and will share his treasure with you. The other dragon
	is greedy and hungry, and will eat you on sight.''')

def chooseCave():
    cave = ''
    while cave != '1' and cave != '2': #2)Fixed indentation
	    cave = input('Which cave will you go into? (1 or 2) ') #3) consolidated code by deleting print function; also added a space for aesthetics
    #4) Corrected variable name from 'caves' to 'cave'
    return cave

	friendlyCave = random.randint(1, 2)

	if chosenCave == str(friendlyCave):

playAgain = 'yes'
while playAgain == 'yes' or playAgain == 'y': #8) Corrected syntax: = to ==
	displayIntro()
	caveNumber = chooseCave() #9) Fixed typo: choosecave() to chooseCave()
	checkCave(caveNumber)
    
	print('\nDo you want to play again? (yes or no)') #10) Put this on a new line for aesthetics
	playAgain = input()
	if playAgain == "no" or playAgain == "n": #11) Added option of user entering 'n'
		print("Thanks for playing") #12) fixed typo
